We have made 3 versions, Synapse, Script-Ware, And all, To officially meet the UNC Standard. We have tested this script to make sure that you can run this on most UNC Executor's, Like KRNL, Fluxus, Hydrogen and more! Though, This is the Script-Ware version, Designed to meet the standards, As it means the script will actually run.
